# muBHNL
Simulation code for the three-body decay of a heavy neutral lepton. Includes tools for determining the lab-frame event kinematics of the final-state particles (assumed to be identical charged leptons that are produced along with a light neutrino). This assumes that the production of the HNL is from a two-body meson decay into a charged lepton and an HNL.

Also included: code for simulating two-body decays of Higgs-Portal Scalars, for comparison against MicroBooNE's analysis of this model.
